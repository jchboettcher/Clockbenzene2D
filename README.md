# Clockbenzene2D

### ABOUT
This program is a depiction of a molecule fictionally known as Clockbenzene (real names are shown in the display. It has 12 carbons situated in a conjugated ring, and so naturally, by moving around its substituents, it can be used to tell time. Enjoy this fun, chemistry-based clock!

### DISCLAIMER
Some of the molecules shown do exist and have been synthesized in research labs, but there is no guarantee that all the molecules are can actually exist. In addition, there is no practical application for using this molecule to actually tell time.

### NOTES
* Due to symmetry, some times yield identical molecules.
* Logistics of the clock itself are given in a description at the bottom of the display window.
* See the 3D version at https://github.com/jchboettcher/Clockbenzene3D.
